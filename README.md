Check out my latest projects here: 
1. [Architech- a platform for contractors](https://github.com/anitahoroszkoorg/architech)</br>
Link to the deployed app: https://architech-362918.lm.r.appspot.com/ </br>
Link to the project in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/DMNwieT1WlqoLA79D4VU6u/Architech?node-id=0%3A1 </br>
I designed this project by myself in **Figma** while proposing an idea to a company that needed better UX for filling their questonnaire by potential contractors.  I created a more user friendly layout for complicated forms. </br> This project was developed with **React** and **Typescript** and used **Material UI**. </br> One of functionalities I've implemented in my code to make the process easier for the user is a **custom React Hook** that automatically fetches information about the company such as name or address and autofills textfields based on user's one input. </br>To make the questionnaire I've used **Formik** library and **Yup** validation so all textfields are filled correctly. </br> Another custom hook I made to avoid prop drilling which is a common problem with bigger amounts of components is a context hook useForm that passes on properties to components a few levels further. </br>The application communicates with backend (created by a backend developer) written in FastAPI and uses Postgres database. </br>To check for any glitches and make sure the app runs smoothly I wrote end-to-end tests in **Cypress**. </br>The app is deployed on **Google Cloud Platform** with **AppEngine** service. The statics are stored on cloud storage. </br> **CI/CD**(github actions) checks **eslint** and **prettier** and automatically deploys to cloud. </br></br><img width = "400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/193845856-bec46da0-3ba3-4ec3-b5ce-c3f00d54b439.png"> <img width = "400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/193865473-bd3074fd-9571-4d73-bb0c-074670bfa687.png">

2. [Daft Academy Certificate project](https://github.com/anitavictoria/daft)</br>
During this course I gained maximum points for creating this app because of it's functonality and optimal code solutions. I've learned best practices from a senior frontend developer and recieved a certificate stating of my skills earned in these 5 weeks. </br> <img width="350" alt="daftrick" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/183860819-cd43cc98-df16-4bc1-af4b-584646f45613.png">

3. [GraphQL Blog](https://github.com/anitavictoria/blog)</br>
This is a blog project created with content housed in **GraphCMS** (a headless CMS) and delivered via **GraphQL API** for seamless display on a blog page. For this purpose I created a **custom React Hook**. I chose a simple, clean design that showcases dynamically changing posts in a chronlogical order. I deployed the app via **Netlify** so it can be viewed under this link: https://graphqlblog1.netlify.app/ </br><img width="350" alt="lab" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/184074617-a7d5775f-339a-4805-8405-4c957362fedf.png">
